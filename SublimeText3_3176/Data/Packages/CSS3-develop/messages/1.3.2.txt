VERSION 1.3.2 CHANGES

1) The url() rule now only highlights quoted URLs. Unquoted URLs are not
   illegal in CSS, but they are discouraged by the spec as legacy code. Unquoted
   URLs have to be specially parsed, have more characters that need to be
   escaped, and do not support URL modifiers. Please update your code.

2) Fixed translate*() rule not matching percentages.
