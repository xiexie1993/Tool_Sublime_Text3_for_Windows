Thank you for installing CSS3!

This plugin requires Sublime Text 3 build 3103 or greater.

I strongly recommended disabling the default CSS package. Its completions will
interfere with the improved CSS3 completions.

    Mac:       cmd+shift+p  -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS
    Linux/Win: ctrl+shift+p -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS

I also strongly recommend adding these two settings to your User Settings (the
general settings, not the package settings). By default, Sublime will not offer
completions inside other completions. In other words, the completions menu is
suppressed when you're tabbing through a snippet. This blocks most of the CSS3
completions from appearing. To fix this, set these keys to true:

    "auto_complete_commit_on_tab": true,
    "auto_complete_with_fields": true,

If you have Emmet installed, its completions will drown out the carefully
researched, standards-based completions in CSS3. You can disable Emmet's
completions by adding the following lines to your Emmet package settings:

    "show_css_completions": false,
    "disable_tab_abbreviations_for_scopes": "source.css"


That's it. Enjoy the plugin. If you have any problems, please open an issue on
GitHub. Thanks!
