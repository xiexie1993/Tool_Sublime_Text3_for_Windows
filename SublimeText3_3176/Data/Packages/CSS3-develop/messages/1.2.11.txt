VERSION 1.2.11 CHANGES

1) Removed the "Insert Reset" and "Insert normalize.css" features

    These were being inserted in minified form. I've been persuaded
    that writing your source in minified form is a bad idea. They
    were out of date anyway.

2) Dropped the beta tag from the Validate call, since no issues have
   been reported.

3) Updated for recent changes to the CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1
   and CSS Template Layout Module specs

4) Support for these new Scroll Snap Points Module Level 1 properties.

    scroll-snap-coordinate
    scroll-snap-destination
    scroll-snap-points-x
    scroll-snap-points-y
    scroll-snap-type

   These are usable with the -ms- prefix, or unprefixed in Firefox 39
   with the layout.css.scroll-snap.enabled flag.

Lastly, if your favorite CSS property isn't being highlighted properly,
or is missing a completion, please report it here:
